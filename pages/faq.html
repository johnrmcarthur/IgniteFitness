  What do I need to do to get started with IGNITE DYNAMIC TRAINING?

  Simply fill out the contact card with all the information and state your interest for one of IGNITE's services and a trainer will be in touch within 24 hours.

  How do I pay for the services?

  Clients have the option to pay via Pay Pal, SQUARE, Check or Cash.

  When are the Training Sessions available?

  Training times are agreed upon based off of trainers availability and clients day to day schedule.  Training sessions can start as early as 6am with the last session scheduled as late  as 8pm.

  Is the Health Assessment part of the training packages for 1 on 1 personal training?

  NO!  The Health Assessment is an important FIRST STEP that is used to qualify canidates before they puchase any training.  Potential candidates are taken through a 4 page questionarre that covers the participants Health History, Medical History, Goals and Expectaions, Programming Advisement and are screened for any Physical limitations.  Once all the information is collected and discussed in detail then given the advice and curriculum of the program suggested, participants can then make an informed decision to committ and move forward with training.  

  Do I need to dress out for exercise during the assessment process?

  Why you wont break out in a sweat, wearing lose and comfortable clothing will be helpful as you go through the physical assessment.

  Are the payments paid in full or are there payment plans?

  As of right now ALL payments from  any of the services are paid in full before your first session.


  Are there refunds for any of the purchases?

  No!  The reason the assessment is so important is that it allows for a clear expectation of the ACTION PLAN that is needed to create change for  the participants.  The psycological influence of making the committment financially only reinforces particpants to stay on course and remain consistant.  So its highly recommended that anyone looking to change their physique  have a clear understanding of this emotional committment and focus  BEFORE purchasing any training packages.

  Do the training session ever expire?

  YES!  However the expiration of each training package is discussed during the assessment processs after taking into account the participants training schedule, goals, and the suggested program designed by your trainer.  Both the trainer and the participant will sign off on the agreed expiration date.  A crucial element to keeping participants focused and on track to be successful with their goals.

  Where do we train? Inside? Outside? at a GYM?

  Most of the training sessions are outside, which has proven to be a welcomed break from all the  hours spent indoors.  Participants are encouraged to even bring their K-9 companions while they train.  The locations for outdoor training are in Nob Hill and in the Marina.  If a client has a fitness facility inside their building and wishes to uitilze that faciltiy then IGNITE will be more then happy to accomodate and meet the participants at their residence.

  I have not worked out in YEARS and I'm worried I wont be able to keep up.  Will I still be able to take a bootcamp class?

  ABSOLUTELY!  The Bootcamp class allows all levels of athleticism to participate at their respected fitness leves.  Participants are encouraged to speak up about any concerns they may have and are NEVER forced or asked to continue to proceed if they are not comfortable.  IGNITE trainers will always adjust any movement to anyone in order to provide the absolute best fitness experience.

  I'm a parent  and I am challenged with finding a babysitter during my training time.  Can I bring my kids with me to my training sessions and bootcamp classes?
  YES! YES! and YES!  Peter is not only a phenominal trainer but he is also a very involved Dad of two and understands the challenges of being a parent.  Your more then welcome to bring your stroller as the workout is never more than a few feet away from your sleeping little one.  Building community among fellow parents is an ongoing effort by IGNITE.  The more the marrier.
