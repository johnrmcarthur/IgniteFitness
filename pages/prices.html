Any member unaccounted for or absent will be deducted a session.  This is to encourage the group to start the journey AS A GROUP and finish the journey AS A GROUP.  This will also allow for the members of the group to not only build relationships and support but also help keep other members accountable.  A great CORPORATE EVENT and Team Training Opportunity
